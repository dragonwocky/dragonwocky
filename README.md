### Hey :wave:

I'm a teenage Aussie programmer experienced in back- & front-end web development and design.
I like to read, cook, play Minecraft and Warframe.

At the moment I'm working on the [notion-enhancer](https://notion-enhancer.github.io),
an enhancer/customiser for the all-in-one productivity workspace notion.so.

Check out [my website](https://dragonwocky.me/) for more info about me, or browse through some of my projects here on GitHub.
