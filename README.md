### hey 👋🏽

i've been coding for fun since 2015 - a bit of minecraft, a lot of web dev, and plenty of other experimentation.

🔭 at the moment i'm working on [chase](https://chase-game.glitch.me) (a pixel art pacman-style dungeon game) and
the [notion-enhancer](https://github.com/dragonwocky/notion-enhancer) (a modloader for the all-in-one productivity workspace notion.so).

💬 want to get in touch? message me on [discord](https://dsc.bio/dragnwocky) at `dragonwocky#8449`.

check out [my website](https://dragonwocky.me/) for more info about me, or browse through some of my projects here on github.

⚡ i've also got a handy guide on a [full setup/configuration of the WSL](https://dragonwocky.me/posts/wsl-setup), if you're interested.
