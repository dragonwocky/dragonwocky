### hey 👋🏽

👨‍💻 i've been coding for fun since 2015.

at the moment i'm working on the <img src="https://github.com/dragonwocky/notion-enhancer/raw/master/mods/core/icons/mac+linux.png" height="14px"></img> [notion-enhancer](https://github.com/dragonwocky/notion-enhancer) (a modloader for the all-in-one productivity workspace notion.so).

if i'm not coding, i'll probably be reading, gaming (mainly horizon zero dawn, minecraft and splitgate), or hanging out with friends.

💸 i'm available for hire to do freelance work.

i have experience with notion, minecraft, discord, web-based games, personal/organisation websites and more. i can build you something from scratch, or set up and modify other software (e.g. ghost/wordpress).

💬 want to get in touch? message me on [discord](https://dsc.bio/dragnwocky) at `dragonwocky#8449`.

check out [my website](https://dragonwocky.me/) for more info about me, or browse through some of my projects here on github.

💻 p.s. i've also got a handy guide on a [full setup/configuration of the windows subsystem for linux](https://dragonwocky.notion.site/wsl-setup-4f75134e465a48f6ab3446f62ade914b).
