### hey 👋🏽

i've been coding for fun since 2015 - a bit of minecraft, a lot of web dev, and plenty of other experimentation.

at the moment i'm working on the <img src="https://github.com/dragonwocky/notion-enhancer/raw/master/mods/core/icons/mac+linux.png" height="14px"></img> [notion-enhancer](https://github.com/dragonwocky/notion-enhancer) (a modloader for the all-in-one productivity workspace notion.so).

💬 want to get in touch? message me on [discord](https://dsc.bio/dragnwocky) at `dragonwocky#8449`.

check out [my website](https://dragonwocky.me/) for more info about me, or browse through some of my projects here on github.

:computer: p.s. i've also got a handy guide on a [full setup/configuration of the windows subsystem for linux](https://dragonwocky.me/posts/wsl-setup).
