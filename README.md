### Hey :wave:

I'm an Aussie programmer experienced in back- & front-end web development and design. I'm studying first-year CompSci/SoftEng and I spend my time gaming, reading, cooking, volunteering and building fun stuff.

At the moment I'm working on the [notion-enhancer](https://notion-enhancer.github.io),
an enhancer/customiser for the all-in-one productivity workspace notion.so.
