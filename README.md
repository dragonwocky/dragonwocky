### Hey :wave:

I'm a teenage Aussie programmer experienced in back- & front-end web development and design.
I like to read, cook, play Minecraft and Warframe.

At the moment I'm working on the [notion-enhancer](https://notion-enhancer.github.io),
an enhancer/customiser for the all-in-one productivity workspace notion.so.

ðŸ“· Want to see some of my other work? Browse through my projects here on GitHub or checkout my [portfolio website](https://dragonwocky.me/).

ðŸ’¬ Want to get in touch? Message me on [Discord](https://dsc.bio/dragnwocky) at `dragonwocky#8449`.

ðŸ’» Want me to build you a website? Send me through what you need and we can work out the details.

ðŸ’° Want to support my open source work? Consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/dragonwocky/).

P.S. I've also got a handy guide on a [full setup/configuration of the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://dragonwocky.notion.site/wsl-setup-4f75134e465a48f6ab3446f62ade914b).
